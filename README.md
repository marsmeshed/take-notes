# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description

I created this project for my module 11 challenge. This project will take your notes, but then will be able to delete unwanted notes, add extra, and edit previous notes. Throughout this project I was able to further understand express as well as JavaScript as a whole.

## Installation

To run this note taker, install express, fs, and path. 
To do so type: "npm install express," "npm install fs" and lastly, "npm install path." into your terminal.
